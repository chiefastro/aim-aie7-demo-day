### Demo Day Project Plan — Agentic Offers and Restaurant Agents (v0)

---

#### 1) Goal ✅ COMPLETED

Ship an end-to-end prototype of the Agentic Commerce Protocol (ACP) for restaurants (Toast-powered online ordering as examples) that:
- ✅ Defines and publishes an open, machine-readable offer feed on merchant sites
- ✅ Indexes those feeds into a Global Offer Registry (GOR)
- ✅ Exposes the index via an MCP server for consumer agents
- Runs a mesh of per-restaurant agents speaking A2A to accept buying intents and “simulate” checkout
- Issues a mocked Attribution Receipt and settles a mocked bounty split to a consumer wallet

Success = live demo where a consumer agent discovers offers, “orders” from a restaurant agent, and receives a bounty credit.

---

#### 2) Naming: Agentic Commerce Protocol (ACP)

**Protocol Name**: Agentic Commerce Protocol (ACP)
- Clear scope: "Agentic" signals AI agent integration
- Industry standard: follows web protocol naming conventions (HTTP, SMTP, etc.)
- Future-proof: can encompass both commerce and content sides
- Professional: sounds like a real standard that could gain adoption
- Clean acronym: ACP

**Feed Format**: Offer Syndication Feed (OSF)
- Purpose: machine-readable feed for publishing offers
- Endpoint: `/.well-known/osf.json`
- Individual items: ACP Offer Document (v0)

**Hierarchy**:
- **ACP** = overall protocol for agent-commerce interactions
- **OSF** = feed format for publishing offers
- **Offer Document** = individual offer within an OSF
- **Attribution Receipt** = transaction proof document
- **Settlement Postback** = merchant confirmation document

---

#### 3) Architecture Overview (mapped to whitepaper)

- Publisher side (merchant):
  - Hosts an OSF endpoint that lists active offers (Offer Documents)
  - Optionally hosts a simple postback handler (mocked for demo)
- Global Offer Registry:
  - Crawls/ingests OSF endpoints
  - Normalizes, signs (demo key), and indexes offers with metadata (time, location, merchant)
  - Provides a search API to agents
- MCP Server:
  - Wraps the GOR search API as MCP tools for agent consumption
- Restaurant Agents (per merchant):
  - Receive buying intents over A2A
  - Present offers, “simulate” checkout and order lifecycle
  - Emit Settlement Postbacks to Transaction Simulator
- Transaction Simulator:
  - Issues Attribution Receipts on intent acceptance
  - Processes merchant postbacks
  - Computes and applies mock bounty splits to wallets
- Consumer Agent:
  - Uses MCP to discover offers and drive the flow end-to-end

##### 3.1) Tech Stack
Python for backend
FastAPI for backend server
LangGraph for agent orchestration
Qdrant for vector DB
Typescript and React for frontend with Tailwind CSS and shadcn

#### 6) APIs (v0)

GOR HTTP API
- GET /offers?query=...&lat=...&lng=...&radius_m=...&labels=pizza,delivery
- GET /offers/:offer_id
- GET /merchants/:merchant_id/offers
- Custom scoring: semantic relevance + geo proximity decay + time freshness decay

MCP Tools (namespaces: offers)
- search → params: query?, lat?, lng?, radius_m?, labels?[] → returns array of offers
- getById → params: offer_id → returns Offer Document
- nearby → params: lat, lng, radius_m → returns array of offers

A2A JSON (Restaurant Agent)
- Common envelope: { "a2a_version": "0.1", "agent_id": "agt_consumer_demo", "nonce": "...", "payload": { }, "signature": "..." }
- present_offer.payload: { "offer_id": "..." }
- initiate_checkout.payload: { "offer_id": "...", "items": [{"sku":"pizza_margherita","qty":1}], "pickup": false, "notes": "no onions" }
- confirm_order.payload: { "order_id": "..." }

Transaction Simulator
- POST /receipts (internal) — create Attribution Receipt
- POST /postbacks — receive Settlement Postbacks
- GET /wallets/:user_id — read wallet balance and history

#### 7) Implementation Plan & Timeline (7 days)

Day 1
- Finalize ACP OSF and Offer Document v0
- Build scraper for 3 Toast merchants and generate static OSFs + Offer Documents

Day 2 ✅
- Implement GOR ingester + validator
- Set up Qdrant collection with custom scoring function (geo + time decay)
- Implement vector embeddings for offer text (merchant name + labels + description)
- Expose GOR HTTP search API with hybrid ranking

Day 3 ✅
- Implement MCP server wrapping GOR
- MCP server provides semantic search tools for consumer agents

Day 4 ✅
- Create mock restaurant web servers on localhost that have any endpoints needed to complete a transaction
- Implement Restaurant Agent template and spin up 3 instances (configs per merchant) - these will be LangGraph agents that make any API calls needed to execute a transaction, and that interact with the user as needed to gather order details.
- Implement A2A endpoints and order state machine - these will be exposed on the fake web servers for the consumer agent to discover in a well known location

Day 4.5 - **ACP MCP Server** ✅ (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Built ACP MCP Server that works with any ACP-compliant merchant
- ✅ Implemented merchant discovery via A2A agent cards
- ✅ Created standardized MCP tools for all commerce operations
- ✅ Used FastMCP with async decorators following best practices
- ✅ **Replaced bespoke MCP implementations** with universal approach
- **ACP SDK Integration**: Update restaurant agents to use standardized ACP SDK instead of bespoke A2A implementations
  - Migrate OTTO Portland to ACP SDK
  - Migrate Street Exeter to ACP SDK  
  - Migrate Newick's Lobster House to ACP SDK
  - Test ACP compliance and skill interoperability

Day 4.75 - **Auto-ACP Toolkit** (NEW)
- **Browser Agent Foundation**: Set up Playwright-based browser automation for merchant website discovery
- **Intelligent Navigation**: Implement AI-powered site structure analysis and workflow detection
- **Form Analysis Engine**: Automatically map form fields to ACP skill parameters
- **Commerce Workflow Detection**: Identify ordering, payment, and fulfillment processes
- **ACP Generation Engine**: Auto-generate ACP SDK compliant skills and merchant agents
- **Validation Framework**: Test generated agents against actual websites
- **Integration Pipeline**: Connect auto-generated agents with Universal Commerce MCP Server

Day 5
- Implement Transaction Simulator: receipts, postbacks, ledger, wallet endpoint
- Wire Restaurant Agents → Transaction Simulator

Day 6
- End-to-end happy path: discover → present → initiate → confirm → receipt → wallet credit
- Add minimal UI/CLI polish and logs for demo clarity

Day 7
- Hardening, error paths (failed orders), geo/time filters, and documentation
- Record a backup demo video

---

#### 8) Demo Script (live)

1) Show ACP OSF on a merchant domain (static server) at `/.well-known/osf.json`
2) Show GOR search for "pizza near Boston"
3) Use MCP server to search for offers via semantic query
4) Call Restaurant Agent present_offer then initiate_checkout (receipt is shown)
5) Confirm order; Settlement Postback arrives; wallet balance updates
6) Show receipt and ledger entries; highlight rev-share amounts

---

#### 9) Risks & Mitigations

- Scraping fragility → store HTML/JSON snapshots; use controlled examples
- Time/geo correctness → use mocked geolocation/time windows for determinism
- Multi-service complexity → use docker-compose or pm2 scripts to run all processes
- Signature/crypto → stub with deterministic demo keys; document as non-production

---

#### 10) Stretch Goals (nice-to-have if time)

- Basic agent disclosure UI (user sees rev-share and consents)
- Map view for nearby offers
- Simple policy-based selection (cheapest delivery fee, fastest prep time)
- Publisher-side OSF validator CLI
- **Auto-ACP Advanced Features**:
  - Multi-language website support (international merchants)
  - Advanced AI models for complex workflow detection
  - Real-time website change monitoring and agent updates
  - Merchant dashboard for managing auto-generated agents
  - Batch processing for large-scale merchant onboarding

---

Agentic Commerce Protocol

Write a succinct 1-sentence description of the problem
Agents are upending the economics of the web yet very little tooling currently exists to support the emerging agentic commerce ecosystem.

Write 1-2 paragraphs on why this is a problem for your specific user
 
For consumers with buying intent, AI agents struggle to complete transactions reliably using natural language - they can discover products but often fail at the actual purchase due to lack of standardized commerce protocols. Users want to say "order me a pizza" and have their agent successfully complete the transaction, but agents struggle to do so on websites designed for humans (UIs and credit card workflows).

For merchants, the shift to AI-powered shopping threatens their ability to serve ads and capture buyer intent effectively. They need ways to continue advertising in this new agent-driven world while maximizing conversion rates when genuine buyer intent exists. For tooling startups building agent commerce solutions, the lack of open standards forces them to build expensive proprietary integrations with each merchant, limiting their ability to scale and serve the growing agent ecosystem.

Write 1-2 paragraphs on your proposed solution. How will it look and feel to the user?

The Agentic Commerce Protocol (ACP) creates standardized commerce rails that enable AI agents to complete transactions reliably using natural language. Merchants publish machine-readable offers at `/.well-known/osf.json` that get indexed into a Global Offer Registry, allowing agents to discover and present relevant options to users. Merchants also publish Sales Associate agents via A2A  at `/.well-known/agents.json`, enabling direct transaction completion. When a user asks their favorite chatbot to "order me a pizza," it can find and interact with merchant agents to reliably complete the transaction.

For users, this means AI assistants can actually complete purchases instead of just browsing - they can say "get me dinner tonight" and have their agent successfully order from the best available options. For merchants, it's a new advertising channel that works with AI agents, allowing them to continue serving ads and capturing buyer intent in the agent-driven world. The protocol includes economic rails (attribution and bounties) to align incentives across the ecosystem, but the core value is reliable transaction completion.

The Agentic Commerce Protocol (ACP) is an open standard that enables AI agents to complete transactions reliably using natural language, allowing users to say "order me dinner" and have their agent successfully purchase from merchants while providing a new advertising channel for businesses in the agent-driven economy.
